# 山中小屋 · v0.3 VS0/VS1 prototype

Source: 山中小屋_游戏策划案_v0.3_HD2D_100Haunt.docx, sections 5–12, 29, 31.2, 34. Uses two concept images embedded in that user-owned GDD.

Static, dependency-free browser game. `dist/engine.js` owns serializable game state and deterministic seeded RNG; `dist/app.js` owns UI, Canvas board, local storage and generated audio cues. `dist/index.html` can also be opened locally. Sites owns project identity in `.openai/hosting.json`.

Implemented: solo party control with traitor AI after reveal; 3–6 player hotseat with pass-device screen; three floors; 24 room definitions with door rotation; 4 discrete trait tracks; 0/1/2 dice; 6 item definitions; 6 event templates; 13 omen cards; end-of-turn six-dice haunt check; fixed Haunt #2 structural adaptation; ritual competition, ghost control transfer, corpse search/carry/burial, countdown, hostile ghost/stun/banishment, peripheral room collapse, combat/death, same-room item transfer, autosave/resume and JSON session export.

Deliberate prototype adaptations, disclosed in in-game help:
- New explorer tracks and simplified card text, not full official content.
- Fixed Haunt #2 instead of the full Room × Omen mapping.
- Ritual anywhere, threshold 4, goal 3; hero success +1, traitor success +2. These are provisional test values, not final balance.
- Basement is directly linked to Grand Staircase.
- Damage automatically allocated to the eligible trait with more remaining track positions.
- Collapse selects leaf rooms to preserve connectivity; rounds with no eligible leaf do not collapse a room.
- No online multiplayer, hidden-traitor security, theft, complete room exceptions or full HD-2D renderer. Hotseat privacy is courtesy-based on a shared browser, not a security boundary.
- Gameplay visuals are a functional isometric board; GDD HD-2D artwork is used for start/reveal screens.

Validation completed: JS syntax and local asset checks; 100 seeded quick-start hero-route simulations reached terminal states; an explicit traitor-control run reached collapse, room mutation and hero victory; seeded RNG/save restore equality, card draw stops movement, pre-haunt death protection and post-death turn advance were checked. No browser visual or end-to-end QA was performed. Initial balance strongly favors heroes in quick start and needs user playtesting.
